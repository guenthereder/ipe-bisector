# ipe-bisector
An ipelet programmed in lua that lets you create a bisector between two lines.

Download the .lua file and place it in your $HOME/.ipe/ipelets directory.

- if two parallel lines are chosen then the line centered between those line is
  drawn

- if two adjacent edges are chosen the bisector starts in their common endpoint
